      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>Full stack web developer with extensive background in film and media. As a former Moving Image Preservation Specialist, I specialized in the preservation and restoration of digital and software-based artworks. I strengthened my skills  with coding because I'm inspired how coding and the tech sector opens access to information worldwide and to diverse populations.
        In my future career, I want to develop technologies that expand information access especially in the media field to new fields and communities. </p>
