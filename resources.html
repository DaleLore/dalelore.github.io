            March 13, 2020 | Open-Source Hardware Summit | Slides | Video Presentation<br>
            Selected as an Ada Lovelace Fellow. As archivists and conservators, we are always trying to make do with what we have available; we adhere to and aim for the highest attainable levels of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance and best digital preservation standards in the face of limited financial, staff, and equipment resources. The workflows and digitization stations we develop are curated to media formats, including analog media such as u-matic, VHS, and DAT. We have been able to develop open source software to help with the digitization and migration process of these formats, but we are facing the problem that these playback decks have become obsolete. Even the contemporary hardware of our workflows have been discontinued. This talk presents a general list of the types of equipment we require in our work and how we troubleshoot issues of obsolescence.</p><hr>
