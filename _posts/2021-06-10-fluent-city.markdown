description: I received my Bachelors of Arts from the College of Arts and Sciences in New York University where I focused on Spanish Film and Media Production. I received honors for my investigation on Paraguayan cinema and defended my thesis, "Ne Hendu Kiriri - Listening to Silence in Four Recent Paraguayan Films". I teach basic Spanish through film, art, and media.
