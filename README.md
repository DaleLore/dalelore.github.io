# dalelore.github.io

Welcome to my github page for the website: dalelore.net

I am a full stack developer from FlatIron/AccessLabs and a moving image preservation specialist from the Moving Image and Archiving Preservation program from New York University.

Steps taken in creating the website:
	▢ Setting up repository in github pages 
  ▢ Buying domain (dalelore.net) from gandi.net ($)
  ▢ Linking this domain with the github page (WIP)
  ▢ Making this website look good (WIP)
  
  Sorry that this is still under construction.
