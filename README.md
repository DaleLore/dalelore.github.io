# dalelore.github.io

Welcome to my github page for the website: dalelore.net

I am a full stack developer from FlatIron/AccessLabs and a moving image preservation specialist from the Moving Image and Archiving Preservation program from New York University.

<br/>

Steps taken in creating the website:
<br/>▢ Setting up repository in github pages 
<br/>▢ Buying domain (dalelore.net) from gandi.net ($)
<br/>▢ Linking this domain with the github page (WIP)
<br/>▢ Making this website look good (WIP)
  
<br/>Sorry that this is still under construction.
