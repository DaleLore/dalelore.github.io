# DaleLore.net

Welcome to my github pages that hosts my website: dalelore.net

Full stack web developer with extensive background in film, television, and media. As a trained Moving Image Preservation Specialist, I specialize in the preservation and restoration of digital and software-based artworks. I shifted my area of focus to coding because I wanted to develop tools and technologies that expand information and access of media and art to new sectors and communities.
